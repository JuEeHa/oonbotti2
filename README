Not that ugly IRC bot. In fact, ircbot.py is quite nice.
(3 years later) Actually, I take that one back. That's quite horrible.

eliza.py is not part of oonbotti2, and is under a BSD-style license. Original
can be found at http://www.jezuk.co.uk/cgi-bin/view/software/eliza

Setup
-----
You should create following files:

trusted.txt: People that have access to #op and friends. Format is
             "##ingsoc nortti\n##ingsoc foobar\n". The account names are case
             sensitive.
gods.txt: Same as above, except can't be #untrust'ed
msgs.txt: Messages that haven't been delivered. Leave it empty
startcmd.txt: Raw IRC messages to send to the server after USER and NICK. Used
              to authenticate with NickServ

Run `python2 ircbot.py irc.freenode.net 6667 '##ingsoc' o2-test`

Console commands
----------------
/j <chan>: Join a channel
/m <recipient> <message>: Send a message to recipient
/q: Quit

/lt: Load trusted.txt
/st: Save trusted.txt (never used, it's saved automatically)
/lg: Load gods.txt
/lm: Load msgs.txt
/sm: Save msgs.txt (never used, it's saved automatically)

You can also run arbitrary IRC commands by prefixing them with '/'. The command
is converted to upper case, but line is otherwise sent raw
